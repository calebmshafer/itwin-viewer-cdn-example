# Examples using the iTwin Viewer

This repo contains a couple different ways to use the iTwin Viewer with the iTwin Platform.

1. The first approach uses the iTwin Viewer from a CDN, in [cdn-viewer](./cdn-viewer/README.md). It is written in html and javascript modules without a bundler such as webpack or rollup.

    This approach requires the lowest amount of code to get started and also supports the [iTwin Embed API](#embed-api).

1. The second approach uses the iTwin Viewer as a React package, in [react-viewer](./react-viewer/README.md).
